										<h4>Introduction to Mechatronics</h4>
										<p>Thanks to my first-person drone project, I had some experience in mechatronics, mainly with the hardware aspect. However, I had yet to learn how my hardware interacted with the programs I was running. The goal of this class project was to be able to design, code, and implement a motor control system. I did so by creating a PID controller using a motor, Raspberry Pi encoder, current controller, and H-Bridge.</p>
										<h4>Implementing My Skills</h4>
										<p>Making a motor track a position required me to use every skillset in my toolbelt. In the hardware aspect, I had to read and understand datasheets to visualize what was happening inside the PID controller. Then, I had to solder pins and wire multiple microchips together so that they worked in unison. In code, I had to understand the different functions and loops I needed to create in order for my hardware to work seamlessly. I was slow and careful in how I built my project. First, I tested the necessary code using an LED as a signal for my analog outputs. Then, I wired each component separately so I could ensure each one worked properly before moving on.</p>
										<p>I believe that it was my approach to tackling this large problem that made me successful. I broke my large goal of finishing the project into smaller, more process oriented goals. Each week I would figure out what I needed to get done to be on track to make the final due date. Instead of waiting till the last moment, I made steady progress and took the time to learn methods that will be with me for the rest of my career.</p>

										<h4>Learning C Code</h4>
										<p>This project is a tribute to my hard work and perseverance. I had no concept of C code before this project and had to learn it from the ground up. Learning C in the process of a project was difficult, but my success in finishing the project can be attributed to my gritty attitude.</p>
										<h4>Debugging and More Debugging</h4>
										<p>My motor control system had so many details that could go wrong. That being said, if there was a mistake to make in my code, I made it. The code I wrote took hours to debug. Towards the end of the project I made one change and it broke the entire PID loop. After asking friends, family, and my professor to look at my code, all it came down to was a missing semicolon. But I did not give up, and it made the reward of getting the code to work worth it. </p>
