										<h4>Summer Fun</h4>
										<p>My personal drone project was born in 2018 as a way for me to do something productive over the summer. I had not had any real experience with drones or the first-person drone community, but I was eager to learn. My dad and I ordered the parts necessary to make it from scratch, and I got to work. </p>
										<h4>Making Mistakes and Growing Pains</h4>
										<p>Coming into this project I had little experience with mechatronics. I did not know how to solder, read a datasheet, and only had a vague understanding of circuitry. This project changed all of that. I practiced soldering before taking my iron to wire up my drone. I burnt plastic, frayed wires, and melted an excessive amount of flux. I fried many microcontrollers and parts with my poor soldering, but eventually got the hang of it. </p>
										<p>The ability to read a datasheet was one of the most important skills I gained from this project. Being able to take technical diagrams and translate them into practical use is difficult but essential. </p>

											<h4>First Flights</h4>
											<p>After months of working, fighting against discouragement, and attacking the project again, the drone was finished. This drone was not a pretty creation, but it worked, and that meant the world to me. </p>
											<p>I was also inexperienced in flying a drone. My hand-eye coordination is poor, and I am not the best with joysticks. Nonetheless, I learned the basics and started bunny-hopping my drone around empty parking lots. During one of my first long-range flights, I promptly crash-landed into the concrete, shattering part of my flight controller. While I am currently rebuilding the drone, I am much more confident in my skills because I learned from the mistakes I have made.</p>
